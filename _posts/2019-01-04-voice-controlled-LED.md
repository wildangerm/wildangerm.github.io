# [TUTORIAL] Voice controlled LED strip using Galaxy S5 and Amazon Echo Dot (Alexa)

What you'll need:
 + LED strip (which is controllable via IR)
 + Samsung Galaxy S5 (or a phone that has an IR emitter, but may not work with the app)
 + Amazon Alexa device (doesn't matter which, I've used an Echo Dot)
 + IFTTT account
 + ngrok account
 + Android application (github link)

I hope you like it!
