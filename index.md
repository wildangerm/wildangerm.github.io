### Interests:
I'm highly interested in the field of IT security, so I might do projects around it as well, but not sure what exactly yet.  
`Update:` I've _won_ in [Avatao's](https://avatao.com/) holiday challenge, so now I have 1 month of premium there. I'll make sure to make the most out of it, but I'm not sure how well it can be shared here.

If you need LaTeX stylings (listings definitions) for `Xtext` and `Xtend` codes, check my [gists](https://gist.github.com/wildangerm) page out.
