## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

You can find the projects that I'm currently working on:
 - [Advent of Code in Java](https://github.com/wildangerm/advent-of-code-2k18)
 - [Advent of Code in Kotlin](https://github.com/wildangerm/advent-of-code-2k18-kt)
 
Also I have two more projects planned in keywords:
 - Spring-boot webapp, MySQL, Thymeleaf, Google OAuth
 - Android, GoPro, stream, Twitch

I'm highly intered in the field of IT security, so I might do projects around it as well, but not sure what exactly yet.
