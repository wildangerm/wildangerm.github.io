## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

You can find the projects that I'm currently working on:
 - [Advent of Code in Java](https://github.com/wildangerm/advent-of-code-2k18)
 - [Advent of Code in Kotlin](https://github.com/wildangerm/advent-of-code-2k18-kt)
 
Also I have two more projects planned in keywords:
 - **WIP** Android, GoPro, stream, Twitch:
     - still in early phase (and local).
     - Core functionality working.
     - **Soon on GitHub!**
 - Spring-boot webapp, Java, MySQL, Thymeleaf, Google OAuth, minimal Vanilla JS
 

I'm highly interested in the field of IT security, so I might do projects around it as well, but not sure what exactly yet.

If somehow you would need LaTeX styling (listings definitions) for Xtext and Xtend codes, check my [gists](https://gist.github.com/wildangerm) page out.
